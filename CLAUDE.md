## Security Rules — Non-Negotiable

- Never put secrets in client-bundled code (`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`, `VITE_*`, `PUBLIC_*`, `REACT_APP_*`)
- Never use Supabase `service_role` key outside server-only code
- Every new table must have Row Level Security enabled with explicit policies
- Every API route must check BOTH authentication AND authorization for the specific resource
- Every webhook must verify provider signatures before any logic
- Validate all input server-side with a schema library (Zod/Valibot/Yup)
- Use parameterized queries only — never string-concatenate SQL
- No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless sanitized with DOMPurify
- Hash passwords with bcrypt (cost ≥10), argon2id, or scrypt

## Never Do

- Never commit `.env*` files (only `.env.example`)
- Never trust prices, IDs, roles, or user_ids from the client
- Never disable RLS to "fix" a permission error
- Never add dependencies without verifying they exist and are maintained
- Never skip webhook signature verification
- Never expose stack traces or SQL errors in production

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).
